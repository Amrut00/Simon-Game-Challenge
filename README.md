# Simon Game Challenge

**Simon Game Challenge** is a memory game where you must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that gets progressively longer and more difficult. The goal of the game is to match the sequence generated by the computer by pressing the colored buttons in the correct order. The game will continue until you make an error, and the sequence will get longer with each correct round.

## Features

- **Memory Challenge**: Repeat the growing sequence of colors and sounds.
- **Color Buttons**: Click on the colored buttons to match the sequence.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases with each correct sequence, showing your progress.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if you make a mistake in repeating the sequence.

## Usage

1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Follow the Sequence**: The game will light up the buttons in a random sequence.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.
4. **Track Your Score**: Each correct sequence adds to your score.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when you make a mistake, and your final score is displayed.
